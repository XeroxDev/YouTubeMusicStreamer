## About
YouTube Music Streamer is a simple app, that allows you to combine [YouTube Music Desktop][ytmdesktop-url] with Twitch and your favourite Streaming Software.
From widgets to commands, everything is possible and the best part, customizable to your liking!

## Features
- **Widgets**: Use some of the pre-made widgets to display information about the currently playing song, or create your own custom widgets.
- **Commands**: Use commands to control YouTube Music, like play, pause, skip, and more. Define your own prefixes, command names, responses and more. Don't like `!info`? Change it to `music info` and make it look more natural.
- **Queue**: View the current queue and control it. Add, remove, or reorder songs in the queue.
- **Blacklist**: Prevent certain songs from being played in your stream. This is useful for avoiding copyright issues or if you don't want to be rickrolled.
- **Bits and Points**: Hook the commands up to Twitch Bits or Channel Points.
- **Free & Open Source**: The app is free and open source. You can contribute to the project, report issues, or just check out the code.
- **Installer & Portable**: The app comes with an installer and a portable version. You can choose the one that suits you best.
- And much more!
